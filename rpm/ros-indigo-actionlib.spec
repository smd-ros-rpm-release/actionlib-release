%description
The actionlib stack provides a standardized interface for interfacing with
preemptable tasks. Examples of this include moving the base to a target
location, performing a laser scan and returning the resulting point cloud,
detecting the handle of a door, etc.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
